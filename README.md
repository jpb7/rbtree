# rbtree
Implementing a red-black tree in C++ using recursion.

The first increment will be a binary search tree without any color flags or rotations.

I'm new to unit testing so its inclusion here is a learning exercise.

Finally, I'm a busy student chipping away at this a few times per week. Progress will be slow.
